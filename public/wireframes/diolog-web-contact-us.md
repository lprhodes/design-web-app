## User Flow
1. User navigates to the Contact Us page via the sidebar navigation
2. User views Diolog's contact information and location on the map
3. User fills out the contact form with their name, subject, and message
4. User clicks the "Send Message" button to submit the form
5. Button changes to "Sent" state to indicate successful submission
6. User can also access the Help Center or main website via the provided links

## Accessibility Considerations
- All form fields have clear labels
- Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*)
- Form validation provides clear error messages for invalid submissions
- Sufficient color contrast between text and background elements

## Implementation Notes
- Google Map integration should use a static map or embedded iframe
- Contact form submissions should be sent to a designated Diolog email address
- Form validation should be implemented for required fields
- "Send Message" button should change state to "Sent" upon successful submission
