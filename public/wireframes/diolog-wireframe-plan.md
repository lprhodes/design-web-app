## Overview

This document outlines the systematic approach for creating wireframes for the Diolog Mobile App based on the provided PRD. The wireframes will visualize the user interface and interactions for each major screen in the application.

## Wireframe Tasks

The wireframe creation process is organized into the following tasks, prioritized by importance and dependencies:

### High Priority

1. **Home Tab Wireframe**
   - Shows the main landing screen with conversation list, trending content, polls, and search
   - Primary entry point for user interaction

2. **Company Conversation View Wireframe**
   - Displays the chat-style interaction between investors and companies
   - Core functionality of the application

### Medium Priority

3. **Companies Tab Wireframe**
   - Shows the list of companies the user is following
   - Provides company discovery and management

4. **Notifications Tab Wireframe**
   - Displays real-time alerts and interactive notifications
   - Critical for user engagement and timely updates

5. **Profile Tab Wireframe**
   - Shows user information and settings
   - Important for account management

6. **Onboarding Screens Wireframe**
   - Visualizes the user registration and initial setup process
   - Critical for user acquisition

### Lower Priority

7. **Company Details Screen Wireframe**
   - Shows comprehensive company information
   - Dependent on Companies Tab and Conversation View

8. **Event Details Screen Wireframe**
   - Shows comprehensive event information
   - Dependent on Company Conversation View

9. **Poll Interaction Screen Wireframe**
   - Shows how users engage with company polls
   - Dependent on Home Tab and Company Conversation View

10. **Search Results Screen Wireframe**
    - Shows filtered search results
    - Dependent on Home Tab and Companies Tab

## Design Guidelines

All wireframes will follow consistent design guidelines to ensure visual coherence:

- **Color Palette**: Primary blue (#1E40AF), Secondary blue (#3B82F6), Accent orange (#F59E0B)
- **Typography**: Inter font family with consistent heading and body text sizes
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px)
- **Border Radius**: Consistent rounding (4px, 8px, 12px, full)

## Reference Wireframes

Existing wireframes will be used as reference for visual style and component design:

- Chatter Monitor Analytics
- Chatter Monitor Alerts
- Chatter Monitor Filter Panel
- Chatter Monitor Mention Details
- Company Chatter Monitor

## Deliverables

For each screen, the following will be created:

1. **SVG File**: Visual representation of the wireframe
2. **Markdown File**: Documentation including:
   - Change log
   - Current version (embedded SVG)
   - Description of the wireframe
   - Key components
   - User interactions

## Implementation Process

1. Create wireframes in order of priority
2. Review each wireframe against PRD requirements
3. Ensure consistency across all wireframes
4. Document each wireframe with detailed markdown
5. Update task status in the JSON file as wireframes are completed
